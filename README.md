# The-multi-feature-digit-dataset
R project

We will analyze a data set including 1500 individuals representing each one a number from 0 to 9. Each of these numbers is modeled by 650 variables. The goal of our report is to find the best ways to predict a digit described by these different variables, either from a point of view of temporal performance (a criterion particularly in the context of massive data analysis) and and the accuracy of the predictions.
